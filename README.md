### Hi there! I'm Fábio Priamo

I...

👾 create (and often share) *things* that solve problems;  
👾 also create *things* that are not intended to solve any known problem;  
👾 help others create or perfect their own *things*;  
👾 fix faulty *things* (and eventually break some other *things* in the process);  
👾 write (a little) about *things*;  
👾 make a living out of *things* (gotta pay the bills!);  

I am constantly...

👾 reading about *things* (and reading the *things* themselves);  
👾 thinking of how *things* behave in different contexts and changing scenarios;  
👾 thinking of how *things* can be used to help accelerate the creation of other (nice) *things*;  
👾 glad to share with absolutely anyone any piece of knowledge I may have about any thing;  
👾 using lots of very nice *things* created and made available by many other very nice people (thanks!);  
👾 learning about *things* from lots of (good) people in a multitude of ways;  

I like...

👾 to stay away from *things* from time to time, because not everything is about *things* (yet) - and that is a nice thing;

Well, that was a lot of *things* (and "👾"s)! Quite often, some of these *things* I'm referring to are *software*.

### Check out these things!

👽 You can check out [some very cool *things*](https://github.com/fhpriamo/soufantech) I have been creating along with the [SouFan team](https://github.com/orgs/soufantech/people).  
👽 You can check out some little things with which I have been thinkering on my [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/fhpriamo).  
👽 You can check out some (mostly dated) *things* I have created on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/fhpriamo).  
👽 You can read some *things* I have being writing about *things* on [my dev.to page](https://dev.to/fhpriamo).  


Just in case you're wondering, I chose to use "👾"s and "👽"s as list bullets for no special reason.
