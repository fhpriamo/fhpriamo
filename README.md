### Hi there! I'm FÃ¡bio Priamo

Since you're here, you may also want to check out some of these:

- [very cool projects](https://github.com/soufantech) I have been creating and maintaining along with the [SouFan team](https://github.com/orgs/soufantech/people).
- code fragments and other things I have been messing with in [my Github gists](https://gist.github.com/fhpriamo).
- (mostly dated) non-commercial projects I have created in [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/fhpriamo) (this is probably where you are).
- technical articles I have been writing on [my dev.to page](https://dev.to/fhpriamo).  

Thank you! C'ya!
